On the Subject of Wire Sequences

â€¢ Within this module there are several panels with wires on them, but only one panel is visible at a time.
  Switch to the next panel by using the down button and the previous panel by using the up button.
â€¢ Do not switch to the next panel until you are sure that you have cut all necessary wires on the current panel.
â€¢ Cut the wires as directed by the following table. Wire occurrences are cumulative over all panels within the module.
